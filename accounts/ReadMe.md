------------------------Customer Product Management System----------------------
The system display product management where the admin posts products where customers can choose from.
Admin is give permission of creating, modifying (updating), and deleting the prdocusts.
A user can only create and delete products.
A user cannot access another user's page or the admin site.
NB: This system is a fully backend designed where logic is implemented in Python/Django. Therefore, I did not concentrate on the frontend(implementing a modern and responsive UI).
